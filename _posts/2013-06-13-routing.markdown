REST is an architectural style that allows intereaction over HTTP of loosely coupled application resources. 
Resources are described by using a uniform resource name (or URN) at your API endpoint (URL). 

As detailed [previously]({{site.url}}/docs/getting-started/#exposing_entities) each **@Drest\Route** must be accompanied with a **routePattern** 
to be used for matching client requests, a **name**, and a set of matching **verbs**. When the drest manager object is constructed your route patterns are read and registered onto a router (Note: you must use caching in production to drastically reduce the cost of this operation).
  
When *dispatch()* is called a lookup is performed on all registered routes (include a verb check). If a single route is matched, then this is used. If multiple routes are matched, then an exception is thrown.

As each route has a unique name which you're able to bypass the routing mechanism with by passing it into a dispatch call. 
This should be the full classname (namespace included if applicable) of the entity class and the route name seperated by double colon ( :: ). For example:
{% highlight php %}
// dispatch a specific route, bypassing the router lookup.
$drestManager->dispatch(null, null, 'Entities\User::get_user');  
{% endhighlight %}

###Parameters

You can add parameters to your routePattern definition by using a colon ( : ) followed by the variable name. Here are some examples:
{% highlight php %}
routePattern="/user/:id" 
routePattern="/users/:status"
{% endhighlight %}
If a match is made on these routes then the parameters interpreted from the URN are available via a **Drest\Request::getRouteParam($name)** call. 
You can access these from a custom [service action]({{site.url}}/docs/service-actions/) like so:
{% highlight php %}
// get an array of all
$this->service->getRequest()->getRouteParam();
// get just the 'status' parameter
$this->service->getRequest()->getRouteParam('status');

{% endhighlight %}

Note on the default \[GET\] service actions, any parameter defined in the route will be used as a filter.

####Wildcarding
Parameters can optionally be used with a wildcard to allow you to match a route that has a number of URN parts. 
The wildcard character is a plus sign (+) which should be used at the end of a parameter declaration like so:
{% highlight php %}
// this will match the path "/users/active/with/other/parts"
routePattern="/users/:status+"

echo $this->service->getRequest()->getRouteParam('status');
// active/with/other/parts
{% endhighlight %}


###Additional Conditionals
Along with matching the route path you can also specify a conditional regular expression for each route parameter to meet. 
If a condition is not met with the URN then the the route is not deemed a match. 

For example you may want to insure an *:id* parameter doesn't match URNs such as */user/billy* by adding a condition that ensures its a decimal. 
{% highlight php %}
 @Drest\Route(
    name="get_user",
    routePattern="/user/:id",
    routeConditions={"id": "\d+"},
    verbs={"GET"}
 )
{% endhighlight %}
 
Or that the a *:year* parameter is of a valid format
{% highlight php %}
 @Drest\Route(
    name="get_applicants",
    routePattern="/applicants/:year",
    routeConditions={"year": "(19|20)\d\d"},
    verbs={"GET"}
 )
{% endhighlight %}
